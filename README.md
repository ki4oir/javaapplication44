Java Homework
Trying to develop an application using a linked list implemented as a stack which reads information from a .csv file.  
At completion, it should have an input constructor that accepts string input, and calls a Push constructor to implement the stack.
It should also have a Print constructor, a Pop constructor, and a Push constructor.
